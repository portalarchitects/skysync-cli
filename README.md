# SkySync CLI

[SkySync](https://www.skysync.com/) is a file sync and migration solution used by many enterprises to securely migrate, copy, and synchronize files across storage system. Whether youâ€™re ready to bridge your disconnected storage environment or looking to integrate and deploy new on-premises systems and/or cloud-based EFSS services, [SkySync](https://www.skysync.com/) is here. 

The SkySync CLI allows you to fully automate and manage your [SkySync](https://www.skysync.com/) instances.

## Installing

For the latest stable version:

```shell
npm install -g skysync-cli
```

## Usage

```shell
skysync-cli --help
```

### Configuring

Any command line option that can be passed in to the SkySync CLI can also be picked up through environment variables (i.e. SKYSYNC_option=value) or through the presence of a skysync-cli.json file any where in the current directory hierarchy. This can be useful if you are managing an instance that is not running locally. You could create a skysync-cli.json file with the url, username, and password so that you do not need to pass it in with every command invocation.

```json
{
	"url": "https://1.2.3.4:9090/",
	"username": "admin",
	"password": "my crazy secret password"
}
```
